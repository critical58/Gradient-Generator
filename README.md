# Write-up ‚úè

Colour theory is a very complicated topic with many niche subcategories that tie in with other subjects like maths and sometimes even physics. In this essay I will be writing about the uses, applications and types of colour gradients.

## Types of Gradient ‚öô
There are multiple types of gradient. Some examples are:
- Two-dimensional gradients.
- Linear gradients.
- Non-linear gradients.
- Radial gradients.
- Conic gradients.
- Elliptic gradients.
- Three-dimensional gradients.

## Two-Step Gradients 
Simply put, two-step gradients are the most rudimentary form of a colour gradient. They are a form of linear gradient that transforms one colour into another in a linear fashion
